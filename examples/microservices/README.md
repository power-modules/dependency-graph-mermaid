# Microservices Example

This example set illustrates a small microservices architecture featuring:

- ApiGateway
- Authentication
- ProductCatalog
- ShoppingCart
- Logging

Two formats are provided:
- `microservices.mmd` — Flowchart
- `microservices_class.mmd` — Class diagram

They are currently static artifacts carried over from the original plugin exploration. If you find them valuable, we can re-add a small generator to produce these from a synthetic graph (no framework dependencies).
